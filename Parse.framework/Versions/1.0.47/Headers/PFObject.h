 completes successfully while the object is still in memory, then callback will be called.
 
 Objects saved with this method will be stored locally in an on-disk cache until they can be delivered to Parse.
 They will be sent immediately if possible.  Otherwise, they will be sent the next time a network connection is
 available.  Objects saved this way will persist even after the app is closed, in which case they will be sent the
 next time the app is opened.  If more than 10MB of data is waiting to be sent, subsequent calls to saveEventually
 will cause old saves to be silently discarded until the connection can be re-established, and the queued objects
 can be saved.
